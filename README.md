#  DotNet Web API Practice – Dapper & JWT Authentication

##  About This Repository

This repository contains my **hands-on practice code** while learning **ASP.NET Core Web API from scratch**.  
It is **not a production project**, but a **concept-practice repository** created to deeply understand how backend systems work in real-world .NET applications.

The purpose of this practice was to build a strong foundation before starting my **full-stack .NET project (Angular + Web API)**.
